Remember, the \"1 inch of fish per gallon\" rule is inaccurate; aim for 1 inch per 2-3 gallons, considering the adult size of the fish.\n",

      "3. **Aquascaping:** Arrange gravel, rocks, plants, and other decorations to create a visually appealing and functional environment for your fish.\n",

      "\n",
      "5. **Water:** Fill the tank with room-temperature water, using a dechlorinator to remove chlorine and chloramine.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Cycling:** Wait for the nitrogen cycle to establish before adding fish. This process can take several weeks. Test the water regularly for ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates.\n",

      "7. **Acclimation:** Introduce fish gradually to the tank water to avoid shock.\n",

      "8. **Maintenance:** Perform regular water changes (every week or two) and monitor water parameters to keep the aquarium healthy.\n",
